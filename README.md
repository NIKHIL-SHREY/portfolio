# Terminal Portfolio Website

A unique, interactive portfolio website that mimics a command-line interface (CLI) terminal. Users can type commands such as `about`, `projects`, `skills`, and `contact` to explore information about me and my work. This project is built with React and designed to provide an engaging developer experience.

## Features

- **Command-line interface**: Type commands to interact with the portfolio.
- **Auto-typing effect**: Simulates typing output like a real terminal.
- **Command history**: Use the arrow keys to navigate through previous commands.
- **Custom commands**: Commands like `about`, `projects`, `skills`, and `contact` provide detailed information.
